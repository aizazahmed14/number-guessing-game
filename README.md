# Description
A simple and fun Python projectâ€”a Number Guessing Game! ðŸŽ®
This beginner-friendly project challenges players to guess a randomly generated number, providing hints like "Too high" or "Too low" until the correct number is guessed. The game also tracks the number of attempts and gives players the option to replay. Perfect for learning the basics of Python programming, including loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

# Features
âœ… Random number generation using the random module.
âœ… Interactive gameplay with real-time hints.
âœ… Tracks the number of attempts for each game.
âœ… Option to replay the game without restarting.
âœ… Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric guesses).

## How to Play
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aizazahmed14/number-guessing-game.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd number-guessing-game
```
3. Run the game:
```bash
python number_guessing_game.py
```
4. Guess the number based on the hints provided.
5. After guessing correctly, decide whether to play again or exit.

```bash
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I have chosen a number between 1 and 100. Can you guess it?

Enter your guess (between 1 and 100): 50
Too low! Try again.

Enter your guess (between 1 and 100): 75
Too high! Try again.

Enter your guess (between 1 and 100): 63
ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.

Do you want to play again? (yes/no): no
Thanks for playing! Goodbye! ðŸ‘‹
```
